Python version I used:

Python 3.11.9

In main.py you can find the flask up. I run It locally so after running main.py you'll get a URL that points to a web server running on the local machine, paste and run it on Chrome's address bar.


In moveoHLS_task.py you can find the implementations for the app function meaning get claims from a path to a google patents page and running the model for clustering the claims.

In grouping_claims.ipynb you can find the my research and analysis.

Inside the folder templates you can find flask_frontend.html the front-end of my up.

I had great time working on this assignment, thank you for the opportunity!
